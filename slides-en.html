        Browser extensions are small pieces of code that make your web browsing experience more fun, more useful, more private or more public.

        ![](framework/img/workshop/extensionExamples.png)

        They usually show themselves as buttons in the top bar of your web browser and allow some extra functionality that doesn't come with your browser by default.

        #Today

        Today we're going to build something in the fun category of browser extensions: We're going to look at how web pages are built, then look at how we can change them.

        The internet needs more cats! So we're going to build an extension that will replace every image on the page with kittens (or the animal of your choosing). It should look a little like this: <!-- .element: class="delayed" -->

        #The folder is the trick

        Note that when you add an unpacked extension to your Chrome, you have to select the WHOLE folder, not just a file inside of it.

        When you add a new unpacked extension, Chrome looks for the manifest file to see what's inside and what it should do next.

        #What is code, though?

        What we generally call "code" is just a set of instructions that tell a computer what to do. Code is a series of commands, that the computer knows how to execute.

        There are many different languages under the umbrella of "code" but they all follow very similar concepts and are built for particular tasks.

        In our case, we're writing JavaScript, which is the common language of web browsers. When we write programs for the Web, we generally write them in JavaScript.

        #Now to our files

        The basics of a browser extension are pretty straight forward. All we have to kick things off are a folder of images, and a file called manifest.json.

        # The Manifest file

        The manifest file is going to come up a lot in this workshop. It's the backbone of everything that your extension is and does. The manifest is where you can set the title and description, icons and all of those fancy details. But it's also where you can ask people using your extension for special permissions to control web pages.

        You have a basic manifest file in your exercises folder already. You can open that and see what's inside now.

    </section>
    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        # Exercise (5-10 minutes)

        Because Chrome is paying attention to the manifest file first, the manifest file is what we can start playing with first. Spend some time familiarizing yourself with the manifest.

        Can you change the name of your extension, change the version number, change the description? Each time you save your file, hit **"refresh"** on the extension in Chrome and see it change right away.



        ---
        ###Note

        Every time you make a change to your code, you have to hit "refresh" on your extension before you can see the changes

        #Changing the icon of your extension

        Software has icons. This we know. We double-click on so many icons it's become a default behaviour for all computers everywhere. So browser extensions can also have icons.

        These icons usually mean something: the shield protects us, the keyhole is for passwords ... the kitties bring us joy.

        Let's add one.

        Change your manifest file to include an "icons" parameter.

        ```javascript
{
  "name": "Getting Started Example",
  "version": "2.0",
  "description": "First project to build a fresh chrome extension",
  "manifest_version": 2,
  "icons": {
    "16": "images/get_started16.png",
    "32": "images/get_started32.png",
    "48": "images/get_started48.png",
    "128": "images/get_started128.png"
  }
}
        ```

      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Changing the icon

        Because people arrive at your extension on different devices, you need to provide a few different sizes of your icons.

        Hint: You can find some stand-in icons in the project folder that you are free to use. If you're familiar with photo editing software like Photoshop, you can also make your own.

        Sometimes you'll get an error when you try to refresh your extension. That might look like this:

        ![](framework/img/workshop/extension_load_error.png)

        The good news it's very clear about what's broken, showing you which line number it's on, which column (how many letters in) and in which file. This makes it much easier to go in and fix it. When you're done, click "retry" to give it another shot.

        #Give it a button

        The biggest thing about browser extensions that most people are familiar with is they come with a button.

        Buttons trigger actions.

        But what the button looks like, and what the button triggers, that's all defined in the manifest. It looks a little like this:

        ```javascript
"page_action": {
    "default_icon": {
      "16": "images/get_started16.png",
      "32": "images/get_started32.png",
      "48": "images/get_started48.png",
      "128": "images/get_started128.png"
    }
}
        ```

      </script>

      <script type="text/template">
        #Press the button

        ![](framework/img/workshop/pressbutton.gif)

        Buttons are really fun. We should make our button do something.
      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        # First we need permission

        The internet being what it is, and consent being a proper requirement to run our code in other people's web browsers, permissions are a big part of writing extensions.

        Permissions also live in the manifest file.

        ```javascript
        "permissions": ["activeTab", "declarativeContent"],
        ```

        Declarative Content is the permission needed to activate the button and actually allow it to do something in the browser.

        This gives our extension permission to access the current tab that you're working in, edit it, manage it, even close it. We use this so we voluntarily limit what our script can do by hiding the rest of the open tabs from it. This is useful so we keep our script simple, but also so we avoid giving people who use our extension the impression that we're after more of their browser data than we really are.

      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        # Asking for permission (team up!)

        Every Chrome extension ever made requires permission to operate. It's just a question of what they want to do and what they need permission from the user to do.

        Take a few minutes with your neighbour to look at some examples of Manifest.json files in other chrome extensions and see what kinds of permissions they're looking for.

        #Next: A script!

        A script is the list of commands that will run in your browser when you click the button. The manifest can point to them so everything ties together very cleanly.

        Referencing a script file looks something like this:

        ```javascript
        "background": {
          "scripts": ["script.js"],
          "persistent": false
        }

        #You can also leave comments for yourself

        If you want to leave little notes for yourself in your code, you can always do so with a // before your note.

        The // is called "commenting" because it tells the computer to ignore that line of text. It's just a note to yourself.

        Comments end up looking something like this:

        ```javascript
        //This is just a comment
        ```

        #The script

        We added a reference to something called script.js in our manifest file.

        We already have the first bit of that file saved in your learner files. It has one function at the top of it that activates your extension button in Chrome.  This just allows you to click on it.

        But what happens when you click on it?

        (Disclaimer: This will get complicated quickly, but just bear with us - we'll be back to the fun stuff soon.)
      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Make your button do something

        This is the big part: making your script listen to your button.

        In you script.js file, underneath the existing function that's already there:

        ```javascript
chrome.pageAction.onClicked.addListener()
        ```

        This is a bit of a mouthful so let's look at it

        - chrome is the browser<!-- .element: class="delayed" -->
        - pageAction is the button \(Remember the pageAction part of our manifest? It's looking there\)<!-- .element: class="delayed" -->
        - onClicked is the wait. Don't run the script right away, wait until we click on the button<!-- .element: class="delayed" -->
        - addListener is the command. When we click, do this:<!-- .element: class="delayed" -->
      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Make your button do something

        It's verbose, that's for sure. Here's the next part:

        ```javascript
function() {}
        ```
        A function is essentially a command, or series of commands, to run on demand. This part sits in between the parentheses for the previous part. It's what will be triggered as soon as you press the button.

        Together, they look like this:

        ```javascript
chrome.pageAction.onClicked.addListener( function() {} );
        ```

        The portion in between the curly braces  {}  is where we focus our attention now.

      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Adding functionality to your script

        This is the part where we use the "active tab" permission we put in our manifest earlier.

        ```javascript
chrome.tabs.query({active: true, currentWindow: true}, function(tabs) { } )
        ```

        Chrome first goes to the active window you have open right now, then the active tab you have open right now.

        Once it finds that active tab, it can run some code in it. That's another function.

        We call these "nested functions" because they sit inside of each other and rely on each other. But they sure make for some confusing reading. <!-- .element: class="delayed" -->

        All together, your script file should look like this: <!-- .element: class="delayed" -->

        ```javascript
chrome.pageAction.onClicked.addListener( function() {
  chrome.tabs.query({active: true, currentWindow: true}, function(tabs) { } )
});
        ```
        <!-- .element: class="delayed" -->


      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Adding functionality to your script

        Now we go one more layer deeper into the matrix.

        Take a deep breath.

        Here we go.

        Inside our latest set of curly braces ( {} ) add this little bit:

        ```javascript
chrome.tabs.executeScript(
  tabs[0].id,
  {code:  'document.body.style.backgroundColor = "green";' }
);
        ```

        Breaking it down

        * chrome is the browser <!-- .element: class="delayed" -->

        #The basic idea of HTML

        HTML is written in tags.

        Tags usually come in pairs &mdash; an opening tag and a closing tag &mdash; to *wrap* the content.  Note the closing tag has a forward slash (`/`).

        ```
        <tag> opening tag --- closing tag </tag>
        ```

        HTML *tags* describe the content inside of them to the web browser.
        ```
        <h1>This tag describes a heading</h1>
        <p>This tag is for paragraphs.</p>

        ```
        <outertag>outer content <innertag>inner content</innertag> outer content</outertag>
        ```

        Nested tags create a family tree-like relationship, often referred to as *parent* and *child* nodes.

        The inner tag is the child of the outer tag.

        ```
        <parent>

        ```
        <img src="images/picture.jpg">
        ```

        An ```img``` tag by itself doesn't do much until you tell it what image file to load. Once it knows what image you want to use, though, then it becomes powerful.

        The manifest tells the browser to listen to what script.js tells it to do.

        Script.js tells the browser to activate the extension button, but not do anything until the button is pressed. When the button is pressed, run anything that's in main.js.

        Instead of changing the background colour, let's do something a little more dramatic.

        ```javascript

        * can be used any time, whenever you need them
        * gives a *name* to a *value*.

        A variable is a named memory location which contains information, to be used at a later time.

        For example, a variable could be used to store a customer's email address.  Then, the variable can be used to send a confirmation email.

        Unlike a lot of tags, ```img``` tags don't have a closing ```</img>``` at their close.

        If you're offline, or the internet is slow where you are, you can use some images already downloaded for your use in the offlineImages folder. To get the URL for those images, just drag them into an empty tab in Chrome and use those URLs instead of the placekitten.com link.

        That link will look something like this:

        ```

        # Loops!

        What it means for us right now: We can loop through all of the images on the page and change each of them to be the image we want.

        That loop looks a bit like this:
        ```javascript
var allImages = document.getElementsByTagName('img');
console.log(allImages);
for (var i = 0; i < allImages.length; i++) {
  console.log(allImages[i]);
}
        ```

        Let's break that down:

        * allImages is a variable that conains a list of all the images on the page.
        * i is a variable that tracks which of the images in the list we're currently working with. It's a number that walks up the list of images with us, starting at 0.
        * So i starts at 0, goes until it's reached the length of all the images, increasing by one every time.
        * At each image, it console.logs that image.

        # Loops IRL!

        Stand up - let's do this IRL.

        First, we're going to need two volunteers to be commands. <!-- .element: class="delayed" -->

        Second, we're going to need someone to be a counter. <!-- .element: class="delayed" -->

        Third, we're going to need the rest of you to be the elements we're looping over. <!-- .element: class="delayed" -->

      </script>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        # Loops IRL!

        Functions: You are dance moves. Come up with your favourite dance move that you want to inflict upon everyone else in the room (JAZZ HANDS!)

        Counter: You're keeping track of whose turn it is to dance.

        Everyone: Wait your turn, when the counter calls your name, you'll be told your dance moves by the functions.

        This is basically the code we're running on ourselves:

        ```javascript
        var participants = allOfYouHereToday;

        for (var i = 0; i < participants.length(); i++) {
            participants[i].naeNae();
            participants[i].jazzHands();
            participants[i].vogue();
        }
        ```

        ...aaaand GO! <!-- .element: class="delayed" -->

        See what happened? The counter allowed the functions to reach everyone in the room, but the functions ran exactly the same commands on every person. We looped over them!

        # Loops!

        In code, loops are difficult to read. There's a lot of punctuation in them and a lot of curly braces and a they're weird looking. No worries.

        Whenever you see:

        ```javascript
        allImages[i]
        ```

        That just means this is one of the images on the page, the image we currently care about, the image that we are about to change, the image our counter has currently selected.

        # A couple of small details about loops!

        1. There's a shortcut. If you start typing 'for' in your Atom editor, then hit the "tab" key, it will automatically expand a loop for you. Nifty!

        2. There are cases where you might have more than one loop in your script. In that case, it makes sense to not use the same counter variable for both of them, because they could get confused with each other. In our example, we're using i as the counter variable name. You can use any variable name you like, but using the same variable for two different purposes is usually a bad idea.

        # Replacing the images

        Now that we have the allImages[i] that represents the image we want to change, we can add a line of javascript in our loop that looks like this:

        ```javascript
        allImages[i].setAttribute('src', 'http://placekitten.com/200/300');
        ```

        That will take the src attribute of the image and replace whatever is currently there with a placekitten link.

        Go ahead. Give it a try. Load up any page and place some kittens (or puppies or bears or Bill Murray).

        ----

        ##Note

        If you're offline, or the internet is slow where you are, this is where you would use the link that references the local image on your personal machine that looks a little something like this:

        ```
        file:///Users/williamwolfewylie/Desktop/clc-intro-to-chrome-extensions/offlineImages/300.jpg
        ```
      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        # Different images here and there

        The placeholder image links have a /200/300 in them. Those are the width and height of the image they're going to put in place.

        So instead of using the same 200x300 image for every image on our page, we can use the appropriately sized image each time.

        To do this, we need to detect how big the original image in that spot was.

        ```javascript
var imageHeight = allImages[i].clientHeight;
var imageWidth = allImages[i].clientWidth;
        ```
        Those two lines create two new variables, and use the clientHeight and clientWidth attributes to store how big the original images are.


      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        # Different images here and there

        Then we can string together those new height and width values into the placeholder image link to tie it all together.

        ```javascript
allImages[i].setAttribute('src', 'http://placekitten.com/' + imageWidth + '/' + imageHeight)

        ```

      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        # Different images here and there

        Altogether now, this is how that loop ought to look (approximately):

        ```javascript
var allImages = document.getElementsByTagName('img');

for (var i = 0; i < allImages.length; i++) {
  var imageHeight = allImages[i].clientHeight;
  var imageWidth = allImages[i].clientWidth;
  allImages[i].setAttribute('src', 'http://placekitten.com/' + imageWidth + '/' + imageHeight)
}
        ```

        ----

        ##Note

        If you're using the offline mode, you can't use the width and height attributes to figure out the best image for the page. But you can randomize the images you have available to you to make the best of it.

        The first variable, baseLink, should be the first part of your own browser's link, not exactly as copied below. All of this goes inside the the for loop.

        ```
        var baseLink = "file:///Users/williamwolfewylie/Desktop/clc-intro-to-chrome-extensions/offlineImages/";
        var imagesToPick = ['100.jpg', '200.jpg', '300.jpg', '400.jpg', '500.jpg'];
        var photoToInsert = imagesToPick[Math.floor(Math.random() * imagesToPick.length)];
        allImages[i].setAttribute('src', baseLink + photoToInsert);
        ```
      </script>

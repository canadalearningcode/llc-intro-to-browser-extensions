## This content is featured in a monthly theme!

In 2019, we want to challenge Canadians to pause and think, learn about, share, and work towards solving issues that affect us all on a global scale – while leveraging the power of technology!  More information on monthly themes [here](https://www.canadalearningcode.ca/code-can-change-the-world/)

*February's theme is ACCESSIBILITY.*

See slide 5 for suggestions on how learners can incorporate this month’s theme into their projects - if they choose to participate.

## Description

### Why learn about browser extensions?
Browser extensions are small software programs that modify and enhance our experience on the web. They range from playful to practical, with the goal of doing one thing, well. Extensions can help customize our browsing experience, or increase productivity by reducing repetitive tasks. In this workshop, we will use code as a tool of empowerment, to develop agency and harness change through building our own extension for Google Chrome!

During this experience, we’ll learn the basics of JavaScript - with a focus on variables and loops - and use this programming language to interact with websites to perform tasks like replacing or modifying content.  We’ll explore permissions and discuss ethics around extensions to help learners protect their privacy online.  Learners will utilize developer tools to explore things like DOM manipulation, and leave with a personalized extension installed in their browser. We’ll also provide resources for learners to modify the extension for additional browsers, and make it available for others to install and use!

This workshop is designed to be a hands-on experience, where learners will:
* learn basic programming techniques and concepts that are translatable to other programming languages
* review the basic building blocks of how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together to create richer online experiences
* load and update extensions using Chrome’s developer mode
* modify and replace elements using JavaScript (more kittens on the web!)
* get an idea of the resources available in order to continue learning

### Contributing

This project uses [editorconfig](http://editorconfig.org/) to maintain consistent coding style. Make sure your text editor has an editorconfig [plugin](http://editorconfig.org/#download) installed.

**Atom Users:** The Whitespace plugin (which is installed by default) has `Trim trailing whitespace` option turned on by default. Turn this off in the Whitespace plugin settings, otherwise it overwrites the setting in [.editorconfig](.editorconfig). This is a known [issue](https://github.com/sindresorhus/atom-editorconfig/issues/3).  This is only required for editing the slides. Workshop learners are not required to add this plugin.
